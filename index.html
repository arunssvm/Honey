		Honey's natural sugars are dehydrated, which prevents fermentation, with added
 		enzymes to modify and transform their chemical composition and pH. Invertases and
		digestive acids hydrolyze sucrose to give the monosaccharides glucose and fructose.
 		Invertase is one of these enzymes synthesized by the body of the insect.</p>
		<p>
		Honey bees transform saccharides into honey by a process of regurgitation, a number
 		of times, until it is partially digested. The bees do the regurgitation and digestion
 		as a group. After the last regurgitation, the aqueous solution is still high in 
		so the process continues by evaporation of much of the water and enzymatic
 		transformation.

		Honey is produced by bees as a food source. To produce about 500 g of honey, foraging 
		honey bees have to travel the equivalent of three times around the world. In cold
 		weather or when fresh food sources are scarce, bees use their stored honey as their
 		source of energy. By contriving for bee swarms to nest in artificial hives, people
 		have been able to semidomesticate the insects, and harvest excess honey. In the hive
 		(or in a wild nest), the three types of bees are:
		</p>
		<p>

		i) a single female queen bee<br>
		ii) a seasonally variable number of male drone bees to fertilize new queens<br>
		iii) some 20,000 to 40,000 female worker bees<br>
